# QR-Generator
The QR Code Generator is a Node.js application that creates QR codes from user-provided URLs. Using inquirer for interactive prompts, qr-image for generating QR codes, and fs for file operations, this tool prompts the user for a URL, generates a QR code image (QR_img.png), and saves the URL to a text file (URL.txt).
